from unsloth.trainer import UnslothTrainingArguments, UnslothTrainer

# Load model with automatic multi-GPU distribution
model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(
    model_name="unsloth/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct",
    device_map="auto",  # Enables multi-GPU support
)

# Configure for distributed training
training_args = UnslothTrainingArguments(
    enable_distributed_training=True,
    distributed_backend="nccl",
    # ... other arguments
)

trainer = UnslothTrainer(model=model, args=training_args, ...)
trainer.train()
```

### Launch Commands
```bash
# 2 GPUs
torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 your_script.py

# 4 GPUs
torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 your_script.py
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Device Mapping
- `"auto"` - Automatic distribution (recommended)
- `"balanced"` - Balanced distribution across GPUs
- `"sequential"` - Sequential placement (legacy)
- Custom dictionary for manual mapping

### Training Arguments
- `enable_distributed_training` - Enable/disable distributed training
- `distributed_backend` - Backend for communication ("nccl", "gloo")
- `ddp_find_unused_parameters` - DDP optimization setting
- `ddp_bucket_cap_mb` - Communication bucket size

- `NCCL_DEBUG=INFO` - NCCL debugging

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility:

- Existing single-GPU code works without changes
- Default behavior unchanged for single-GPU systems
- Multi-GPU features are opt-in via `device_map="auto"`
- Legacy `device_map="sequential"` still supported

## üß™ Testing

Run the test script to verify the implementation:
```bash
python test_multi_gpu.py
```

This tests:
- Import functionality
- Distributed utilities
- Training arguments creation
- Trainer class structure
- Example file existence
- CLI script updates

## üìä Expected Performance

Multi-GPU training speedup expectations:

| GPUs | Expected Speedup | Efficiency |
|------|------------------|------------|
| 1    | 1.0x            | 100%       |
| 2    | ~1.8x           | ~90%       |
| 4    | ~3.4x           | ~85%       |
| 8    | ~6.4x           | ~80%       |

*Actual performance depends on model size, batch size, and hardware.*
